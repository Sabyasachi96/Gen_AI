    "Instead of constructing things from the ground up, this course will focus on spot-lighting tools that you can use and diving into them as necessary to figure out exactly how they work. And the best tool to start our journey into language modeling is **HuggingFace &#x1F917;!**\n",
    "\n",
    "[**HuggingFace**](https://huggingface.co/) is an open-source community that offers simple strategies for accessing, uploading, and using large deep learning models for testing and deployment. The topics they support span many tasks and modalities, but we'll be focusing on large language models (**LLMs**) for most of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching through the [HuggingFace Models catalog](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=bert), you'll quickly stumble upon the [`bert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) model. Taking a look at its card, you'll see several interesting things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading in the model requires the use of the [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) package. This is the HuggingFace package used to support most of the platform's language modeling code. Its name, `transformers`, refers to the primary architectural structure underlying many of these models, and we'll be talking about this structure in some detail throughout the next notebook. From here on out, you'll want to get comfortable with `transformers` and will be using it quite a bit, so feel free to search around and dive into the source code if you feel like it!\n",
    "2. The card describes a default version that can be pulled in for mask filling (to be discussed) via its [Pipelines]([https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines]) support. By **pipeline**, we mean the end-to-end process of going from a human-reasonable input to a human-reasonable output. This makes it super-easy to pull in the model and helps you to forget that there is a tensor-in/tensor-out differentiable process going on somewhere under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a representative example, we can go ahead and pull in the discussed [`bert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) model and test it out!"

Much of this is [*embarrassingly parallelizable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel), so the thousands of cores associated with many modern GPUs (especially the [CUDA cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) of NVIDIA GPUs) are incredibly useful for speeding up the forward and backward passes. \n",
